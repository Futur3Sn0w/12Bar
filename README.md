## Installation:
**Note:** The current version of 12Bar **requires** DesktopCoral to be installed to use it within apps.  
This won't be required forever, but the app's built-in docking functionality isn't quite ready yet!  
Follow the steps below to get started.

1. Download 12Bar and DesktopCoral:  
https://github.com/Futur3Sn0w/12Bar/releases/latest  
https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/other-windows-apps/desktopcoral

2. Install and open DesktopCoral's options  
   Change the options to match below:

3. Run 12Bar!  
   Running 12Bar before opening DesktopCoral will cause issues, so be sure to run it first!


## Options Popup
You can change options within 12Bar or exit it from the options popup, which you can open at any time from the tray icon!  
Double-click it to jump to settings, or right click for more options.
